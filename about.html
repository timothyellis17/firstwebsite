    <p class="mission"> In Life, the one thing that connects us all is experience. We often take our experiences for granted, but these are the very moments that help shape, nurture, and guide us into the beings we are meant to be. The experiences that we share with each other, help create a sense of oneness with others. The quality of life is based on the quality of your experiences, so in a way, youâ€™re experiences are your own work of art, engraved into this canvas that is life. So, what experiences are you ready to create? </p>
